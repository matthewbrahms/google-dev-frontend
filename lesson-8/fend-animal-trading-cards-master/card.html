			<p>Site Reliability Engineers are highly regarded and very hard to find in the wild. Common areas of expertise are: containers, container management, source code management, observability, Linux, metrics (i.e. uptime, latency, errors, throughput), and culture. Typically one can find a good SRE embedded in a development team near them!</p>
